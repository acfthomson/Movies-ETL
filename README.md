# Movies-ETL

## Overview
Fictional company Amazing Prime needs to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. Code will be refactored to create one function that takes in the three files and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
